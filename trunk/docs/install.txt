Installation Instructions for Tex2RTF
-------------------------------------

Binaries are supplied for Windows 3.1 and for Sun workstations.

If these don't work for you, or you are using a different system, you
will need to compile Tex2RTF. There are several options for doing this.

(1) GUI version

If you want to have a graphical interface for Tex2RTF (not essential for a
conversion utility!) then you will need wxWidgets 2.9.2.

Under Windows, just type 'nmake -f makefile.vc' if you're
using a Microsoft-compatible compiler (you'll need to
change the makefiles or build project files for other compilers.)

(2) Non-GUI version

Under Linux, simply use the target 'nogui'. The supplied files in the
src/wxwin directory supply the essential utilities from wxWidgets, and
Tex2RTF will be built as a command-line program.

On Windows, add 'NOGUI=1' to the makefile command line.
